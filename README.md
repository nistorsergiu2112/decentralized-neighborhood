# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

In this project you will be minting your own tokens to represent your title to the properties. Before you mint a token, you need to verify you own the property. You will use zk-SNARKs to create a verification system which can prove you have title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property. We covered the basics on zk-SNARKs in Privacy lesson in Course 5
